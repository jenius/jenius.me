jenius.me
=========

My personal website.

> **Note:** This is currently in development and not yet live. It will be a modernized, slimmed down, mobile-friendly, and much simpler version of what I currently have up.

### Setup

- `$ npm install roots@2.1.0-beta4 -g`
- `$ git clone https://github.com/jenius/jenius.me && cd jenius.me`
- `$ roots watch`

### Production

This will be live at http://jenius.me. Deployment is private for obvious reasons.
